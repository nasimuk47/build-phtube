            <h5 class="text-xl">
                <span class="text-xl font-semibold">Question 1:</span> Discuss
                the scope of var, let, and const?

                <span class="text-xl font-bold">Answer:</span> In JavaScript,
                var, let, and const are used to declare variables, but they have
                different scopes and behaviors. Understanding their scopes is
                crucial for writing clean and maintainable code.<br /><br />
                <div class="">
                    var: ~ when you need function-level scoping and are not
                    concerned about some of the quirks it has.<br /><br />
                    let: ~ when you need block-level scoping and may need to
                    reassign the variable.<br /><br />
                    const: ~ when you need block-level scoping and want to
                    ensure the variable's value remains constant after
                    initialization, though you can still modify properties or
                    elements within the variable if it holds an object or array.

        <!-- Question 2 -->
        <section class="bg-green-300 mt-5">
            <h5 class="text-xl">
                <span class="text-xl font-semibold">Question 2:</span> Tell us
                the use cases of null and undefined?
            </h5>
            <br />
            <h4 class="font-bold">
                <span class="text-xl font-bold">Answer:</span> In JavaScript,
                null and undefined are two distinct values with specific use
                cases. <br /><br />
                undefined: ~ for variables that have not been assigned a value
                or for function parameters that are not provided when calling
                the function.
                <br /><br />
                null: ~ when you want to explicitly indicate the absence of a
                value or to clear a reference to an object. It's often used when
                you need to distinguish between "no value assigned" and "value
                intentionally set to nothing."

        <!-- Question 3 -->
        <section class="bg-purple-400 mt-5">
            <h5 class="text-xl">
                <span class="text-xl font-semibold">Question 3:</span> What do
                you mean by REST API?
            </h5>
            <br />
            <h4 class="font-bold">
                <span class="text-xl font-bold">Answer:</span> REST API stands
                for Representational State Transfer Application Programming
                Interface. It is an architectural style for designing networked
                applications, and it is one of the most common approaches for
                building web services and APIs on the internet. REST is not a
                protocol but rather a set of constraints and principles for
                designing web services that are scalable, maintainable, and
                easily consumed by clients.<br /><br />

                HTTP Methods: ~ REST APIs use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT,
                DELETE, etc.) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
                operations on resources. These methods are mapped to the
                standard HTTP verbs, making the API intuitive and
                self-descriptive.<br /><br />

                Layered System: ~ REST allows for a layered architecture, where
                intermediaries like load balancers, caching systems, and proxies
                can be placed between clients and servers without affecting the
                overall system's functionality.
